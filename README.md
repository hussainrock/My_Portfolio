Project3: Data Professionals survey Breakdown
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>

In this data-centric project, I conducted an in-depth survey analysis among data professionals, extracting meaningful insights and translating them into powerful visualizations. Prioritizing data integrity, I meticulously cleaned the dataset, ensuring no anomalies in null values, empty columns, or incorrect data types. The project showcases diverse visualizations, including stacked bar charts revealing the average salary by job title and stacked columns illuminating the popularity of programming languages. Gauging work-life balance and salary satisfaction through dedicated charts added a nuanced perspective. The treemap detailing job titles across countries shed light on global workforce dynamics. By employing Power BI's capabilities, I crafted a comprehensive narrative that speaks to the challenges faced in breaking into the data field and the gender-based salary disparities.
